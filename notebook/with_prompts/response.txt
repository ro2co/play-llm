In the sky, a curious sight
Fell from above, on this rainy night
Cats and dogs, in a mad delight
Poured down like rain, in a strange, wild light

Whiskered felines, paws first, did fall
Their eyes gleamed bright, as they took the call
Of gravity's pull, that brought them to ground
Where they landed with soft thuds all around

Canines joined in, with tails held high
Barking with joy, as they touched the sky
Their paws wiggled free, as they danced and spun
A furry, frantic, rain-like throng had begun

The cats and dogs mixed, in a playful heap
As they tumbled down, in a crazy leap
No one was harmed, just a wild delight
In this strange, and whimsical, rainy night.
